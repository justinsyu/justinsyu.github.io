			<p>“Use of reSET-O is associated with significant and durable real-world reductions in ED and inpatient (including readmissions) utilization, reduced net costs, and increased clinician services and buprenorphine adherence. Differences in costs versus controls were greatest among Medicaid patients.”</p>
			
			<h3><a href="https://www.hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health: Online exercise therapy</a></h3>
			<p>“The largest-ever medical claims analysis of a digital MSK solution demonstrated that Hinge Health reduces medical claims by $2,387 per participant compared to a control group, delivering a 2.4x ROI.”</p>
			<p>“Third-party analysis showed a 2.7x ROI for Medicare driven by reductions in medical-service use and annual healthcare savings.”</p>
		
			<h3><a href="https://www.treatmyocd.com/">NOCD: Mobile application for obsessive compulsive disorder</a></h3>
			<p>“The total behavioral healthcare cost for the identified 4% of OCD members is approximately $12,276 per member, amounting to a behavioral health spend of $5.3 million annually. The total cost of care for the remaining OCD population (the hidden 96%) is roughly $8,600 per member†, amounting to $98.9 million in behavioral health spend, much of which is paying for inappropriate or otherwise wasteful care.”</p>
			<p>“Summing up the total OCD population, including identified and submerged (hidden) members, reveals payers are spending about $104.2 million per year per one million members, or $8.69 PMPM*—all to achieve suboptimal outcomes in many cases.”</p>
